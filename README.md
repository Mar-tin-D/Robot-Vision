In this project the work "Dynamic Point Field" , by Sergey Prokudin, will be evaluated.
It will be done in tow way, the first is the evaluation of the Chamfer distance of the predicted and target points cloud and the second is a visual representation with color coding for the point which corresponds to their origianl/source coordinates.

The first section is used for surface reconstruction, since CAD-models lack the need vertices to work with them as dense point clouds.
This part is straight from the work "Dynamic point fields".
